# Tweet-Textbox

A dummy simulation for twitter tweet box, supporting only text (up to now)

So, I made a simple tweet box with HTML, CSS (I'm not a hero in CSS so don't expect perfect styling or responsiveness) & JavaScript. Applying on what I've learned in JS like events & DOM manipulation.

If you wrote something in the box, the tweet button will be enabled. once you've got 20 or less characters left, the counter color will change to gold, once no characters left or you've exceeded your character limit, the counter will turn into crimson red and the button will be disabled again, but you can still write inside the box.
